        Diabetes, hypertension, asthma: These are some of the most common diseases New Yorkers are diagnosed with. Many get prescriptions from their doctors to help treat their symptoms. Yet not everyone can get their medication — and pharmacy access is one reason
        why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight million New Yorkers are scattered around the city. But major pharmacies such as CVS, Duane Reade and Walgreens, and Rite Aid — which accept insurance and Medicaid, and are more likely to have essential medicines on stock — are clustered in wealthy
        neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s hard to go to the main pharmacy,” said Kirsten VanHoose, 28. She lives in Harlem on 146th Street and 7th Avenue and goes to the CVS on 125th St. “If you show up to get the prescription, you stand in a long line down the aisle. It doesn’t matter
        what day you go or what time you go. You will wait for an hour.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In Harlem, there are only eight pharmacies in the 10039 ZIP code. About 43 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and 28 percent of residents living in poverty are 65 years and over. That’s more than double the rate in New York City.
      </p>
      <p>
        VanHoose is on Medicaid and said her options are even slimmer than those with other health insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I have Health First and Duane Reade stopped taking my insurance, so I’m forced to go to CVS,” said VanHoose.
        <p>
          A lack of pharmacy access disproportionately impacts low-income New York communities. It means people who don’t live near a major pharmacy can’t pick up their prescriptions when it’s convenient. It means obtaining medicine is more costly. And it means
          that it’s harder for communities with high rates of diagnoses — especially of chronic illnesses — to get the treatment they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We talk about prevention and insurance,” said Sarah Sheffield, executive director of NYCRx, a nonprofit that works to lower drug prices. “But we don't really talk about how [people] are going to get the pills that we know help them.”

          Low-income neighborhoods have fewer total pharmacies, according to pharmacy registration data from the New York State Department of Education, which also tracks pharmacy licenses around the city. That makes it more difficult for low-income residents to
          take care of their health. This is especially the case when considering that pharmacies in low-income neighborhoods tend to be local, and not part of a major chain like CVS.

        </p>
        <p>
          Research from SUNY Downstate Medical Center and CUNY Lehman College found that local pharmacies are more likely to be out of stock of essential medicines used to treat common illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes and asthma. This puts residents at
          an even greater risk of not being able to get the medicine they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s such an inconvenience to go to a local pharmacy in my area, and they not have what I need,” said VanHoose. “I want to support local businesses, which will help my community grow, but if they don’t have what I need, I can’t do that.” VanHoose said
          that many people in her neighborhood are older and may have more health needs that she does. She said this is why having more options in the area will benefit everyone on the age and income spectrum.
        </p>
        <p>
          This problem compounds for low-income residents with chronic health issues, and puts up greater cost barriers to getting treatment. People fill their prescriptions where and when it’s convenient for them -- which Sheffield, of NYCRx, said is often after
          work or on the weekends, near their homes. And while people rely on local pharmacies to get their medication quickly, it also means they have to pay out of pocket, because local pharmacies generally do not accept Medicaid or insurance. Because
          chronic illnesses last a lifetime, it means customers need to pay these extra costs more often. All of this makes it more likely that patients will forgo treatment they need.

        </p>
        <p>
          “If the people in lower income neighborhoods have more prescriptions and they have less access to pharmacies that stock those medications, they’re all sort of stacking up against low-income New Yorkers,” said Sheffield, of NYCRx.

          Academics have researched pharmacy deserts and their effects on health. But access to pharmacies hasn't been a specific focus of New York City health officials. In recent years, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has increasingly acknowledged
          the stark health disparities across race and socioeconomic that exist in the city, and released various reports on the subject and initiatives aimed at tackling its different causes. It includes plans to create neighborhood health action centers
          in parts of the city with poor health outcomes, which would offer space for primary care in addition to various non-clinical social services. Carolina Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the health department, pointed to this work when asked about
          pharmacy access.

        </p>
        <p>
          While limited access to health care and services in some neighborhoods has been noted more broadly within these initiatives, disparities in pharmacy access are only beginning to be studied by the department. Madhury Ray and Francoise Pickart, risk analysts
          for the city health department, recently conducted an analysis on pharmacy access, mapping all pharmacies within a 15 minute walk from one of the city's 39 low-cost health centers.

        </p>
        <p>
          There hasn't been any legislation on pharmacy deserts in New York yet. But more public discussion of the issue could change that.


        </p>
        <p>
          Pharmacy access has gotten attention in other parts of the country, and in some instances elected officials have taken some action. The Chicago Tribune reported on growing concerns among health experts and residents about pharmacy deserts in mainly low-income/majority
          black or Latino neighborhoods in Chicago. In February, Indiana Rep. Charlie Brown, who represents Gary, Indiana -- 25 miles away from downtown Chicago -- in the state House of Representatives, introduced a bill urging the Legislature to conduct
          a study of pharmacy deserts across the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of ZIP codes with the fewest number of pharmacies, most are concentrated in the outer boroughs, with the most acute shortages in Queens, especially southeast Queens, and in Staten Island.
